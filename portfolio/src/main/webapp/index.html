      <p>Hi all! My name is Sami and I am a Junior at Yale University studying Physics and Computer Science. 
          I love both exploring and codifying the patterns that govern our world. When I am not studying, I 
          work in an interdisciplinary Neuroscience lab studying fly behavior, give tours to
          perspective students, and tutor students in an introductory Physics class.</p>
      <p>I also love practicing on the Club Gymnastics team, planning events for the Women in Physics group, volunteering 
          in local elementary schools, and debating in the Yale Political Union. </p>

        <p>In 2017, I programmed autonomous drones at MIT's Beaverworks Summer Institute.
            I worked in a small team to plan, program, and race an autonomous air vehicle.
            While there, I not only learnd principles of computer vision, image recognition, 
            and navegation, but also how to break down a large problem and communicate 
            effectively on a team.

        <p>Starting in winter 2020, I used machine learning to analyze fly image data at 
            the Clark Lab of Yale. The Clark Lab performs experiments on fruit flies in
            order to larn more about their precepts and map out their brain functionality.
            I analyzed images from an experiment which explored depth perception by examining
            how flies cross gaps of various width to identify the position and the behavior 
            of the fly.

        <p>From winter 2019 through summer 2019, I worked in Yale's Ultracold Quantum Matter
            Lab. While there, I updated the control software for atomic physics experiments a
            in order to increase compatibility with new hardware and software packages. I
            also wrote molecular dynamics simulations to better inform the trapping of 
            Bose Einstein Condensates.
