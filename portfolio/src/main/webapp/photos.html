      <p>Some things that I really enjoy photographing are the treats
          that I have been baking while staying at home during the pandemic.
          So far I have made lemon cake, peanut butter cake, key lime pie, 
          oatmeal cookies, and many other baked goods. Some were shared with 
          family of neighbors, but most were just eaten by me and my family. 
          Delicious!</p>
